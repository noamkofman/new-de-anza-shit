Preparing well for the minor helps students move efficiently toward graduation. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Rady School of Management\u2019s Entrepreneurship and Innovation (E&amp;I) Minor is designed to provide students with a breadth of understanding of business and entrepreneurship theory, practices and applications. The E&amp;I Minor will appeal to creative and ambitious undergraduate UCSD students who envision launching and managing their own business or entering careers in innovation-driven fields. There are five main goals for the overall curriculum that will be pursued pragmatically: 1) cover a broad context of the application of entrepreneurship and business principles, 2) develop a comprehensive view of innovation within and operations of both established business and start-up business operations, 3) be application-oriented and provide experiential learning opportunities, 4) provide course work in a unique area not available elsewhere on campus, and 5) through course work and faculty guidance, help innovative students cultivate and expand on their business ideas. The curriculum includes a two-course practicum requirement, MGT 121A and MGT 121B Innovation to Market, that will give students the opportunity to apply their knowledge of entrepreneurial theories and innovative thinking strategies in a classroom setting.</p><p><br></p><p>1.)
