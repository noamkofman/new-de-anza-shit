        "content": "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a new major at UC Berkeley starting Fall 2025. Applicants to the <strong>Environmental Engineering</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses 6for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB BIOLOGY 1B</p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A+1AL</p><p>- UCB CHEM 1B; or CHEM 3A+CHEM 3AL; or PHYSICS 7B; or MEC ENG 40</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB READING AND COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application) If no articulation exists, students are strongly encouraged to take a course in Statics AND a course in Computer Programming.</strong></p><p>- UCB CIV ENG 11; CIV ENG 30; CIV ENG 70; CIV ENG 93</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI C8</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages</strong> students from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of </strong>the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.
