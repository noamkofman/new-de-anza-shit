It is our hope that students will not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, and viewers of the whole artistic event.</p><p><br></p><p>The practical focus of the major is to create theater of all kinds using all its art forms. Whether new to theater or seasoned with years of training and skill, all students receive an education that engages them fully. Your focus may be on acting, technical theater or design, performance studies, or some combination of these. Equally important to us is the study of theater and dance performance theory, history, culture, and literature, thereby balancing the practical with the theoretical. Students engage in other upper division electives in stage management, playwriting, directing, choreography, sound design, scenic design, costume design, or lighting design, as well as a myriad of performance opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>The theater training and academic courses offered by our department are geared toward the student who is interested in learning about theater and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Theater and Performance Studies, you will study with nationally and internationally known faculty, respected for their scholarly research and for their creative work. Our graduates have gone on to professional careers in all theatrical fields and graduate schools all over the world. Our alumni include professional actors on stage and screen, arts journalists, stunt actors, directors, producers, playwrights, and more.</p><p><br></p><p>Further departmental opportunities include student-directed theater performances and projects, honors projects, internships in local Bay Area theaters, teaching courses in the department, and invitations to diverse and exciting lectures and performances. Students also have access to world-renowned visiting guest artists through our close relationship with Cal Performances and our extensive network in the field.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p>Laxmi Kumaran</p><p>Undergraduate Academic Advisor</p><p>Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies</p><p>15-B Dwinelle Hall (Level C)</p><p><a href=\"mailto:laxmik@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">laxmik@berkeley.edu</a></p><p><a href=\"http://tdps.berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tdps.berkeley.edu</a></p>",
