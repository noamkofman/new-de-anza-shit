Based upon a portfolio review and transcripts, most transfer students are placed in first year, some are placed in second year, and very few are eligible to be placed into the third year of the program.

Some courses may be accepted for degree credit after a student has been admitted, and the transfer credits have been reviewed by departmental faculty.

Not all students that have a GPA of 3.2 or higher will be admitted as the number of students admitted each year is based on the number of spaces available. The admissions office selects students based on highest GPA and works down the list (from highest to lowest GPA) until all seats have been filled.</p><p><br></p><p>Transfer students who are offered admissions to the program, or are placed on a wait list for admission, will be invited to submit an 8 1/2\u201d by 11\u201d bound portfolio of their work so that the department can determine in which year of study each student should be placed. The department offers a portfolio workshop for accepted transfer students in early spring semester in advance of placement. The workshop provides advice and coaching to produce an effective portfolio, however the workshop does not guarantee advanced placement or a remedy for deficient work. THE PORTFOLIO IS NOT USED TO DETERMINE ADMISSIONS, IT IS ONLY USED TO DETERMINE PLACEMENT (1ST, 2ND OR 3RD YEAR). If no portfolio is submitted, students will be automatically placed in the first year design studio.</p>",
