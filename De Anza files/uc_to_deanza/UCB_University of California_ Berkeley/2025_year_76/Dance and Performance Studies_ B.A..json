Of equal importance is the study of theater and dance theory, history, culture, and literature.&nbsp;The dance training and academic courses offered by our department are rigorous and geared toward the student who is interested in learning about dance and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Dance and Performance Studies, you will study with faculty known nationally and internationally for their scholarly research and creative work. Many of our graduates have careers in professional dance companies. Other students have gone on to graduate study in a wide variety of arts-related fields and have developed careers in universities, non-profits, and professional fields in health care, education, and business.</p><p><br></p><p>The opportunities in our department are many and varied. They include regular student-led performances, an annual dance concert where students perform in faculty and guest artist repertory pieces, the option to participate in an honors thesis/project, and exposure to a diverse range of exciting lectures, speakers, guest artists, and performances.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p>Laxmi Kumaran</p><p>Undergraduate&nbsp;Academic Advisor</p><p>Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies</p><p>15-B Dwinelle Hall (Level C)</p><p><a href=\"mailto:laxmk@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">laxmk@berkeley.edu</a></p><p><a href=\"http://tdps.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tdps.berkeley.edu</a></p>",
