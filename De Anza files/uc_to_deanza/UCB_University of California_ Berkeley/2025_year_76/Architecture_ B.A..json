        "content": "<p>This major is offered by the College of Environmental Design (CED).</p><p><br></p><p>The undergraduate program in <strong>Architecture </strong>leads to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Through its core courses, the program offers a broad introduction to the field of architecture, and through studies in the various areas it provides opportunities to prepare for specialization in the field in the areas of architectural design and representation, architectural technologies and building performance, architectural history, society and culture. In addition to offering a sound and well-rounded education, undergraduate studies can also provide pre-professional competency for entry-level employment in architecture, the option for graduate work in architecture, or further studies in a related environmental design field.</p><p><br></p><p>Many graduates go on to obtain Master of Architecture or related degrees; others work in architectural offices, construction, government, or industry. Employment opportunities exist also at the community level, particularly in those communities which traditionally have not been served by professional architectural practice. The overall aim of the undergraduate program is to establish a strong foundation for a diversity of careers and to provide for mobility and flexibility to suit changing individual opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Accreditation and Licensing</strong>. The BA degree is a pre-professional degree and provides the foundation for entry to a Master of Architecture program, the most widespread professional degree program in Architecture in the US. The BA degree can also be applied toward licensing requirements in the State of California. See the National Architectural Accrediting Board <a href=\"http://naab.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">naab.org</a> for more information on accreditation.
