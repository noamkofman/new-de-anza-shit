See details on preparation for this major below.</p><p><br></p><p>The<strong> History of Art</strong> major is designed to give students solid grounding in the many artistic traditions that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Further it prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence (visual and textual), and to create coherent sustained arguments. In a series of increasingly focused courses, the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual and material evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are designed to maximize exposure to different traditions, while allowing enough flexibility for individual students to develop and pursue their own particular areas of interest and a coherent area of focus.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information: </strong></p><p>Major Advisor, History of Art Department</p><p>(510) 643-7290</p><p><a href=\"https://arthistory.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/major-requirements\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://arthistory.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/major-requirements</a></p>",
