It provides students with the opportunity to explore the rich diversity of Mediterranean antiquity in depth, alongside a relatively small cohort of undergraduates. While language study is an option, the major may be completed entirely in English. This major provides excellent preparation for various careers, including law, medicine, teaching, writing, and business, as well as for graduate study in fields such as Anthropology, Archaeology, History, and Art History.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Direct Admission</strong></p><p>If you are admitted to UC Berkeley intending to major in Ancient Greek and Roman Studies, you will be directly admitted into the major. This means you do not need to apply or declare the major separately after admission.</p><p><br></p><p>To ensure a smooth transition and help you plan your coursework effectively, all admitted transfer students are required to meet with our undergraduate advisor shortly after admission. This meeting will help you develop a program plan to complete your major requirements and stay on track for graduation. You will receive information on how to schedule this meeting, either through Golden Bear Advising program or an email from the advisor, before the start of your first semester..</p><p><br></p>",
