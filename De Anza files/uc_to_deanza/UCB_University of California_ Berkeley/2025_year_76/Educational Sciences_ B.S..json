The Educational Sciences major explores the field of education via academic inquiry and direct engagement with schools, families, and local and global communities. Through multidisciplinary training and participatory practices in school-based and community contexts, students will come to understand learning inside and outside of official institutions and will learn how to critically analyze current issues in education. The role of digital technologies in a networked world, and their capacity to elide educational time and space, will be an object of study.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>There are no lower division major requirements available for articulation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
