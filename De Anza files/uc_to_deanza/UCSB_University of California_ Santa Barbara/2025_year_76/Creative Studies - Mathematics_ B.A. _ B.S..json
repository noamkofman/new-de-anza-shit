The curriculum was developed to accommodate students who are able to move to a high level of mathematical inquiry at a pace faster than the usual university curriculum would allow. Since most community college mathematics courses cannot apply to the requirements for this major, transfer students typically require a minimum of three years to complete this degree. Classes in Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Multivariable Calculus are strongly encouraged prior to applying to join the program. </p><p><br></p><p>For information about this major, please visit the College of Creative Studies website: <a href=\"http://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.ccs.ucsb.edu</a></p>",
