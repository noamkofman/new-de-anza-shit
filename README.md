# Project Summary
This project was made because of the struggles many Community College students face when trying to plan for transferring.
I especially understand these struggles as trying to make a plan that fits all your desired schools is difficult and one 
small mistake can lead to another year at Community College. The main site for transferring is [assist.org](url), which 
lists all the requirements but does not aid in making a clear plan for the user, that is what I have done.
