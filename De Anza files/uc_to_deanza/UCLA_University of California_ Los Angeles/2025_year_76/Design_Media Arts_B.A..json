        "content": "<p>The Department of Design | Media Arts (DMA) emphasizes visual, audio, analytical theoretical, and technology-mediated work in design and media arts. Please note that this is NOT a graphic design major, but an academic program that supports a diversity of interests around design, media, technology, and culture. Our integrative curriculum invites students to balance their aesthetic sensibility with logical reasoning, formal theories with practical application, and contemporary thought with a historical perspective. Most transfer students take three years to complete the program.</p><p><br></p><p>Admission to Design | Media Arts is highly selective: we receive many applications for limited spots. The most important admission criteria are the supplemental application which involves additional essays, a design portfolio, strong academic performance, and evidence of community engagement relative to interest in the major.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Please refer to this document that DMA has prepared, that outlines learning outcomes for their lower division classes and possible equivalents from community college: <a href=\"tinyurl.com/bdfh4vne\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/bdfh4vne</a>. Look broadly across your available course curriculum, in any and all areas having to do with art, architecture, design, computer science, information systems, multimedia, interactivity, communications, journalism, et al, to identify possible matches for coursework in drawing, color theory, two-dimensional and three-dimensional form, digital media/computer design, programming for media arts, letterforms and typography, design history, design culture, and interactivity and media arts.</p><p><br></p><p>The availability of arts coursework at community colleges can differ, so you may not find exact equivalents for all classes. However, this will not negatively affect your admission. Look for the closest matches in your curriculum, and if a course wasn't completed at your current institution, you can take it at UCLA. Substitutions for lower-division requirements will be determined by the department in the summer following admission. Syllabi or other descriptive course documentation may be required for consideration.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Recommended (not required) preparation for the major*:</p><ul><li>One course each in drawing, color theory, two-dimensional and three-dimensional form, digital media/computer design, programming for media arts, letter forms and typography, design history, design culture, and interactivity and media arts.</li></ul><p>*Most transfer students complete these courses at UCLA.</p><p><br></p><p>Supplemental Requirements:</p><p>In addition to the general UC Application, applicants must submit a supplement that consists of a visual arts portfolio and additional writing statements. Additional fees may apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>All students must have a cumulative 3.0 GPA at the time of application.</p><p><strong>Students MUST complete the requisite two English courses and one Math course by the end of Spring prior to transfer.</strong> Students are encouraged to take their required English and Math courses as early as possible with at least one English course completed by the end of Fall. Completion of IGETC is not required but strongly recommended.</p><p><br></p><p>More information may be found at <u style=\"color: rgb(41, 98, 255);\">https://</u><a href=\"http://www.arts.ucla.edu/apply\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">arts.ucla.edu/apply</a>.
