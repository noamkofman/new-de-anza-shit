Students may only apply to the major once, no exceptions. The application will require unofficial transcripts, essays, a prerequisite GPA calculation form, and a resume. Admissions requirements and application instructions: <a href=\"https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Undergraduate Admissions</a></li><li>Transfer students must complete all of the lower division prerequisites (mathematics, biology, and social sciences). A minimum grade of \"C-\" is required for any of the prerequisites.</li><li>It is crucial that all students applying to the public health major have a BACK UP MAJOR since admission into the Public Health major is not guaranteed.</li><li>In your first year, it is strongly encouraged to enroll in Data C8: Foundations of Data Science. This course is a major requirement, not a prerequisite for the major, however, it will help prepare you for other major course requirements. This is a very technical course, so please plan accordingly.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Most transfer students complete the majority of their lower-division prerequisite courses prior to UC Berkeley. However, transfer students may fulfill the remaining requirements during their first semester at UC Berkeley. If you have completed all your prerequisites the Spring before you start your first semester at UC Berkeley, you may be eligible to apply in the May application cycle.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For more information about applying to the major during your first semester at UC Berkeley, read more about the Undergraduate Admissions at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Public Health Undergraduate Program</a>&nbsp;or contact an undergraduate advisor at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:sphug@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sphug@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you know that we also offer a Global Public Health Summer Minor? There is no application for the summer minor but there is a declaration and completion form. The GPH Summer Minor consists of 5 courses that can be taken within one or two consecutive summers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE REQUIREMENT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Seven units from the following Biology classes: BIOLOGY 1A (3); BIOLOGY 1B (4); MCELLBI 32 (3); MCELLBI 38 (3); MCELLBI 50 (4); MCELLBI 55 (3); NEU C61 (3); NUSCTX 10 (3). A minimum grade of \"C-\" is required. You cannot split any class series.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lab units do not count towards the seven unit requirement.</strong> For example, BIOLOGY 1AL is not required for the major but is usually required with the BIOLOGY 1A lecture. The lab will not be counted for prerequisite units for the public health major.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You must complete all courses in a series at the same school.</strong> Unless the course equivalents are separately specified, do not assume that a sequence can be divided. If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., BIOL 101 and 102 and 103 = BIOLOGY 1A &amp; 1AL), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must be completed at the same community college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MATHEMATICS REQUIREMENT*&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A part 1 and part 2 from the following.
