        "content": "<p>The Department of Art is committed to professional art training within the context of a research university. The department provides students with a broad experience to the arts and encourages new fields of investigation. Students work in more than one medium and explore mixed media possibilities as well in areas of painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, new genres, and theory. The program's intent is to provide the framework, both through coursework and independent study, to assist each student in developing their own body of work.</p><p><br></p><p>Admission to Art is highly selective: we receive many applications for limited spots. The most important admission criteria are the <strong>supplemental application</strong> which involves additional essays, a portfolio, and evidence of community engagement relative to interest in the major.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The availability of arts coursework at community colleges can differ, so you may not find exact equivalents for all classes. However, this will not negatively affect your admission. Look for the closest matches in your curriculum, and if a course wasn't completed at your current institution, you can take it at UCLA. Substitutions for lower-division requirements will be determined by the department in the summer following admission. Syllabi or other descriptive course documentation may be required for consideration.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Recommended (not required) preparation for the major*:</p><ul><li>One course each in Drawing, Sculpture, Painting, Photography, Ceramics, and New Genres (performance art, video art, installation, and non-studio work).</li><li>Four courses (total) in Art History, including one course covering each of the following art historical periods, preferably with a global context: 1850-1920s, 1920s-1960s, 1960s-present.</li></ul><p>*It is common for transfers to complete these courses at UCLA.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Supplemental Requirements:</p><p>In addition to the general UC Application, applicants must submit a supplemental application that consists of additional essays and a visual arts portfolio. Additional fees may apply.</p><p><br></p><p>All students must have a cumulative 3.0 GPA at the time of application.</p><p><strong>Students MUST complete the requisite two English courses and one Math course by the end of Spring prior to transfer.</strong> Students are encouraged to take their required English and Math courses as early as possible with a least one English course completed by the end of Fall.</p><p><br></p><p>Completion of IGETC is not required, but strongly recommended.
