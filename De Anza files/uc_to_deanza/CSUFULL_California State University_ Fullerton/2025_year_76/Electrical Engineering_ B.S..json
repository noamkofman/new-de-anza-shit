The program provides students with the knowledge of basic and advanced topics in the areas of design and analysis of VLSI and electronic circuits, and computer engineering, including designing and analyzing computer architecture and&nbsp;microprocessors, communication systems, signal processing and control systems. It develops a student\u2019s&nbsp;ability to apply design and analysis knowledge to the practice of electrical engineering in an effective and professional manner. This knowledge can be applied to various engineering practices in aerospace, computer, electrical, electronics and other applied fields.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to the requirements for the major, students must meet all other university requirements for a bachelor\u2019s degree.
