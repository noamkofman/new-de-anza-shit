# Project Summary
This project was made because of the struggles many Community College students face when trying to plan for transferring.
I especially understand these struggles as trying to make a plan that fits all your desired schools is difficult and one 
small mistake can lead to another year at Community College. The main site for transferring is [assist.org](url), which 
lists all the requirements but does not aid in making a clear plan for the user, that is what I have done.

# Guide
- The front page looks like this with prompting the user for their school and Major, Autocomplete is added to help with convenience

- The second  page is this with it showing the user wich classes he must take and giving the user the option of picking wich classes he prefers when allowed.
It then makes them a class list of all the classes he must take for transfer and this can be done repeatedly for as many schools as you want
